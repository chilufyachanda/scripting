Morphological characterisation of low and high oil sunflower(Hellanthus Annuus. L.)Varieties for use in marker assisted selection,"Chinyundo, Anthony","Morphological characterization was done on three sunflower varieties; CCA81, Milika and Record in order to see morphological differences for possible use in marker assisted selection. The parameters that were looked at are leaf size, leaf shape, colour of leaves, number of leaves per plant, hairiness at top of stem, days to 50 % flowering and maturity, seed colour, presence of seed stripes, colour of seed stripes, position of seed stripes, shape of seed, weight of 100 seeds, kernel and oil percentages. Significant differences were noted in leaf size, plant height, days to 50 % flowering and maturity. Record had the highest oil percentage of 42.97, Milika 38.77 and CCA81 42.17. In the other parameters no significant differences were established. Variation among these characteristics is important because it allows for development of varieties adapted to specific environments or agro-climatic regions",
Instruction based formative assessment in selected Colleges of Education in Zambia: It's use and factors affecting its use,"Mwale, Fred M.","The purpose of the study was to evaluate the use of Instruction Based Formative Assessment in   Colleges of Education in Zambia. The objectives of the study were to establish the use of Instruction Based Formative Assessment during lectures, to determine the predominant Instruction Based Formative Assessment strategies being used and to examine factors affecting the use of Instruction Based Formative Assessment in Colleges of Education in Zambia.\r\nThe target population was Lecturers and Coordinators of Continuous Professional Development (CPD) and Open Distance Learning (CODEL) in colleges of Education in Zambia. A total of 120 respondents participated in the study. There were 100 lecturers and 20 coordinators (10 CPD, 10 CODEL). Quantitative survey research design was used to capture national wide data covering 80% of the provinces of Zambia. Data was collected using   structured questionnaires. Data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software that generated frequencies and percentages which were used in describing distributions of single and summated variables.\r\nThe study established that: (i) Instruction Based Formative Assessment was used by both coordinators and lecturers during lectures in Colleges of Education in Zambia. However the frequency of using this type of assessment, varied among coordinators and lecturers.                (ii) The predominant   Formative Assessment technique used in Colleges of Education was the technique that involved “providing feedback that moves learners forward in their learning” while the predominant Formative Assessment activity was that which involves “getting students to peer assess their work”. (iii) The predominant factors that affected the use of Instruction Based Formative Assessment in Colleges of Education in Zambia were “time limitation” and “large class size”. In view of the findings of the study, the following recommendations were made:     (i) Administrators of colleges of education should ensure that lecturers in Colleges are given in-service training in student centred instructional and assessment strategies, which include instruction based formative assessment. (ii) Administrators of colleges of education should establish CPD policy of training and orientation of new lecturers in Instructional and assessment strategies. (iii) Ministry of Education, Science, Vocational Training and Early Education in collaboration with Colleges of Education administrators, should ensure that, learner centred Instructional and assessment strategies, with emphasis on an orientation towards formative assessment, is included as a specific component of the teaching methods training curriculum and should be included in the school experience appraisal monitoring tool.",
"Use of scientific calculators in the teaching and learning of school mathematics: the case of one secondary school in Lusaka, Zambia.","Mashekwa, Mashekwa","Thesis~The use of scientific calculators in the teaching and learning process of secondary school Mathematics in the Zambian education system began in 2001. Since then, there has been lack of the Zambian context research evidence regarding the use of scientific calculators in the teaching and learning process. In this regard, the present study was intended to contribute to the knowledge about the use of scientific calculators by learners and teachers of Mathematics in secondary schools. A qualitative approach and specifically a case study design was used because it provided a systematic way of acquiring in-depth understanding of the phenomenon which was being investigated. The sample comprised of 8 teachers and 24 learners of secondary school Mathematics. The teachers were selected using a homogeneous purposive sampling technique while the learners were chosen through self-selection sampling technique. In respect of data collection, participant observation schedules, unstructured interviews, focus group discussions and a performance test were utilized. Data accessed through observations, interviews and group discussions were analyzed thematically while the data derived from the performance test was analyzed through exploration of learners’ answers to specific test questions. Analysis of the data showed that teachers of Mathematics supported the use of scientific calculators in the teaching and learning process of Mathematics. Teachers argued that calculators made learners to be over dependent on the gadget even in instances where simple computations are involved and had a salient effect of robbing learners of the necessary ability to think mathematically. Furthermore, learners demonstrated occasional lack of ability to effectively use scientific calculators, for example, in topics such as indices and fractions. This discovery suggested that learners are rarely taught the major functions of a scientific calculator or even how to operate calculators. Moreover, it was found out that teachers also lacked capacity to adequately and appropriately use the functions of scientific calculators. It is therefore recommended that schools adopt unique models of scientific calculators whose functions are easy to use by learners. In addition, subject association programs could provide opportunities for teachers to familiarize themselves with the use of scientific calculators in teaching of Mathematics.\r\nKeywords: Scientific calculator, teaching and learning Mathematics, performance, Zambia.",The University of Zambia
An assessment of teachers' competences in career guidance in selected Schools in Solwezi District Zambia,"Banda, Christopher","M.ED~The purpose of the study was to assess the competences of teachers in Career\r\nGuidance in selected secondary schools of Solwezi District in North Western\r\nprovince of Zambia. The objectives of the study were; to establish evidence that\r\nteachers were providing Career Guidance to learners, determine knowledge levels of\r\nteachers who provide Career Guidance, establish competences such as; counselling\r\nskills, ability to relate school subjects to careers and employment requirements and\r\nattitude of teachers who provide Career Guidance, assess what motivated teachers to\r\nprovide Career Guidance and to find out the extent to which learners were satisfied\r\nwith the Career Guidance Services they were receiving in schools. The study\r\nfollowed a survey design using a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods.\r\nData was collected from a sample of 133 respondents and participants from seven\r\nSecondary schools disaggregated as; 70 subject teachers, 49 learners, 7 Head\r\nteachers and 7 Guidance teachers. Simple random sampling technique was used to\r\nselect subject teachers and learners while Purposive sampling technique was used to\r\nselect Head teachers and Guidance teachers. A Questionnaire, Focus Group\r\nDiscussion guide and Interview guide were used to collect data from subject\r\nteachers, leaners and Head teachers and Guidance teachers respectively. Quantitative\r\ndata were analysed using descriptive statistics using Microsoft Excel while\r\nqualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. The research findings revealed\r\nthat: there was evidence that some teachers were providing Career Guidance to\r\nlearners which included Career guidance appearing on the school time table in some\r\nschools, reports on career talks, conferences, and visits to work places. Concerning\r\nknowledge levels subject teachers and some Guidance teachers had less knowledge\r\nin Career guidance as most of them were not trained in Guidance and Counselling.\r\nAs regards competence, most teachers did not have much knowledge and skills in\r\nCareer guidance as a result they were unable to link some school subjects to careers\r\nand employment. However, love to help learners motivated them to provide Career\r\nGuidance. Some teachers felt it was their duty to help learners to choose, plan and\r\nenter into their chosen careers. Concerning the extent of satisfaction, 53% of the\r\npupils were not satisfied by the career guidance services they received from their\r\nteachers because they were not able to easily make career choices, prepare for their\r\ncareer choices and enter them. The study therefore, recommended that Ministry of\r\nGeneral Education should scale up capacity building of teachers in Career Guidance.\r\nKey words: Assessment, Competences, Career Guidance, Subject teachers.",University of Zambia
The status of guidance and counselling provision in selected Basic Schools in Mumbwa District,"Makumba, Chivuna Edward","The purpose of the study was to investigate the status of guidance and counselling in seleted basic schools of Mumbwa District. The objectives of the study were to: establish the status of guidance and counseling in basic schools; determine the type of guidance and counseling services available in basic schools; establish the category of pupils who benefit most from guidance and counseling services in basic schools; and investigate challenges faced by the guidance and counseling teachers in the provision of guidance and counseling in basic schools. A survey approach was used to conduct this research. The sample size was 100 pupils and100 teachers in charge of guidance and counseling services in selected schools in Mumbwa District.The findings of this study were that: rural teachers provided guidance and counselling services; majority of pupils did not report their problems to guidance and counselling teachers but to their class teachers because they believed that the guidance and counseling teachers did not keep confidentiality; girls benefited more than boys from guidance and counseling services; grade 8 and 9 pupils benefited more than any other grade from guidance and counseling services; guidance and counseling teachers faced a lot of challenges in providing counselling services in basic schools which included non-availability of adequate guidance and counselling materials in schools for effective execution of duties, limited time allocated for counseling, lack of parental and community support, poor record keeping by the guidance and counseling teachers; lack of trained teachers in guidance and counseling, lack of office accommodation; lack of cooperation from pupils; influence of culture;  and the lack of both male and female counsellors in schools to attend to pupils needs as some cases are so confidential that they cannot be presented to the opposite sex. The study recommended that: Ministry of Education, Science, Vocational Training and Early Education should (i) employ trained full-time guidance and counselling teachers in schools (ii) provide appropriate and adequate materials for counseling purposes (iii) put in place a deliberate policy that would allow provision of guidance and counselling to lower grades in primary schools which is lacking at the moment.",

To determine the short-term outcome of combined Ventriculoperitoneal Shunting and Myelomeningocele repair at the University Teaching Hospital,"Makawa, Daniel","Background and Objective: There is paucity of data on the outcome of combined VPS insertion and myelomeningocoele repair, and whether this will reduce morbidity and mortality. This study was designed to address this research question.\r\nMethod: Prospective descriptive interventional study was used and patients were recruited between January and October 2009, giving a total of 22. Information on sociodemographic, referral status, preoperative and postoperative outcome was documented and analysed.Result: Males constituted 54.7% and females 45.2% of cases. The youngest age at presentation was 1 week, the oldest was 32 weeks. The majority (90%) were referred from clinics and hospitals outside Lusaka, and most hail from poor socioeconomic backgrounds (64%). The malformation occurred in the lumbar and sacral regions in 77.4%. Most of the patients presented with normal and mild forms of neurological impairment. Ultrasound examination showed that 90% had mild findings and 9% had moderate form of hydrocephalus. All patients were shunted and had surgical closure of the sac. Postoperative complications were seen in patients who had oedamatous (59%) and infected wounds (9%). One patient had CSF leakage and later died of meningitis. Average hospital stay for all patients was 25days.Conclusion: Being the only referral hospital and the only centre with neurosurgical unit for all public institutions, children born with such defects outside Lusaka will continue being seen late.Although the sample size was small, it could show that even when they come late, a combined surgical approach can still be recommended in such patients. Most of the patients operated on recovered well postoperatively, but period of hospital stay was too",
"Effects of bacillus thuringiensis var.Israelensis and Bacillus Sphaericus larvicides,on mosquitoe Abundance, Diversity and Distribution in Selected Areas of lusaka urban district,Zambia","Kandyata, Alister","Effects of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) and Bacillus sphaericus (Bs) biolarvicides, on mosquito abundance, diversity and distribution in selected areas of Lusaka urban district, Zambia, were investigated. Four study areas including parts of the dam/stream systems of the Kalikiliki/Ibex hills area; Venta/Manzi valley area; Chelstone-Zambia airways marshy ponds area, and the Chamba valley brick factory area were selected, based on their being parts of areas where the Larval Source Management (LSM) programme using Bti and Bs was being implemented by the Ministry of Health in the district.\r\nThe study hypothesised that the anopheline mosquito species, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, was the dominant vector of malaria in Lusaka urban district; LSM using Bti and Bs reduced the abundance and diversity of anopheline mosquito larvae in their breeding sites; and that the use of Bti and Bs affected anopheline mosquito species distribution. Study Specific objectives were to: assess the ratio of mosquito colonised habitats to potentially available habitats in the study areas before and after larviciding; identify species of mosquito larvae and adults present in the study areas before and after larviciding; assess mosquito abundance, diversity, distribution patterns and species dominance in the study areas before and after larviciding; and to compare incidences of malaria prior to and after the larviciding programme in the study areas.\r\nBiolarvicides (Bti and Bs) were sprayed on freshwater bodies in the study areas in June and July, 2011 using Hudson X-pert pressure pumps and a fixed-wing, single-engine aircraft. Incidences of malaria prior to and after larviciding were determined by reviewing and analysing health facility records of positive malaria cases attended to by health facilities in the study areas.\r\nNone of the major malaria vectors reported for Zambia in the literature from the Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l) or the An. funestus s.l were identified from the study areas. Instead three anopheline mosquito species; Anopheles coustani Laveran, An. squamosus Theobald and An. rufipes Gough, were found in the study areas. Anopheles coustani (13.5%) and An. squamosus (9.5%) were collected from all four study areas, while An. rufipes (1.1%) was only found in one study area. Prior to larviciding, culicine mosquito larvae were the most abundant (75.9%) in the study areas. No Culicidae larvae of any species were found in the freshwater bodies after larviciding. Possible reasons for the absence of known major malaria vectors from the study areas are suggested. The potential of biolarviciding as malaria vector control intervention for integration with Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and Insecticide Treated bed Nets (ITNs) are discussed. Incidences of malaria were higher prior to larviciding (2-17%). Positive malaria cases dropped drastically, after larviciding (2-4%), in all four study areas. However, though numerically very small, percent-wise, rises in malaria positive rates, were observed in Chainda area by second month post-larviciding but continued declining in the other areas. Possible reasons for the slight rise in the incidences of malaria were due to case importation. This study recommended the integration of Bti and Bs LSM into the Malaria Control Programme in Zambia.",
An assessment of the intergration of anti-gender based violence component in pre-marriage training in Lusaka district,"Swetu, Ruth","Thesis in adult education~The study sought to assess the integration of anti-Gender Based Violence (GBV) component in pre-marriage training in Lusaka District. The Pre-marriage training both from the Christian and traditional perspective is assumed to be one measure that can be used to reduce cases of Gender Based Violence. The study had the following objectives; to examine the existing contents of pre-marriage training on GBV offered by marriage counsellors; to determine the extent to which the methods used in the pre-marriage training enhanced the learning of anti- GBV behaviour among couples and to establish participants’ views on the effectiveness of pre-marriage training on preventing GBV.\r\nThe study employed a descriptive survey design, in which both qualitative and quantitative techniques were used to collect the necessary data. The population was theoretical. The study targeted couples, traditional and Christian counsellors. A sample of 60 participants was used, comprising 50 married participants, where at least one partner was trained, (32 women and 18men) 5 Traditional Counsellors and 5 Christian counsellors. Purposive sampling was used to select key informants among both Christian and traditional counsellors. Homogeneous and snowball was used to select the couples who had undergone pre-marriage training. Questionnaires and interview guides were used. Qualitative data which was collected from the informants was analysed using content or thematic analysis. This was done using emerging themes. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, percentages and tables were generated and analysed using SPSS. Limitation of the study was that it was only conducted in Lusaka district when in actual sense pre-marriage training is conducted all over the country.\r\nThe findings of the study were that pre-marriage training does not address issues of GBV adequately because it was still prevalent among couples that underwent pre-marriage training The contents of pre-marriage training did not have GBV as an independent topic. The other finding was that the methods the facilitators and counsellors used were not adult education teaching and counselling methods. GBV was not the aim of the pre-marriage training but marriage sexual activities and how a woman should please man in marriage were paramount.\r\nThe study recommended that anti-GBV should be included in pre-marriage training as an active topic and facilitators and counsellors should undergo training in the use of adult teaching and counselling methods. It was further recommended that the awareness of GBV in both church and traditional settings should be given priority in pre-marriage training. The vulnerable must be empowered with necessary skills and competencies to be able to mitigate GBV in a marriage setup.",University of Zambia

Detection of Vancomycin resistant Enterococci from clinical specimens at University Teaching Hospitals,"Kaziwe, Simpokolwe","Enterococci are commensal gram-positive bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of humans. They have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens due to their ability to acquire and confer antimicrobial resistance genes, hence making management of infections due to Enterococcus species difficult. Resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics, especially Vancomycin is of special concern as Vancomycin resistant genes are encoded on plasmids which can be transferred to other organisms. Currently, there is no documented information relating to the occurrence and resistance genes of VRE at the University Teaching Hospitals (UTH’s) in Lusaka Zambia. To isolate and determine the occurrence of Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and the genes responsible for VRE resistance from blood, urine and pus specimens received in the Microbiology Laboratory at the UTH’s, Lusaka. This was a cross-sectional study. Enterococci were isolated from urine, pus and blood specimens submitted to UTH’s Microbiology Laboratory from July to August 2017. Enterococci isolation was done by culture of specimens on blood agar, cystine lactose electrolyte deficient medium (CLED), and Bile Esculin Azide (BEA) agar. Presumptive identification of VRE isolates was carried out using Brilliance VRE chromogenic media. Identification to species level, antibiotic susceptibility testing and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) was determined with the Vitek 2 compact. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to confirm presence of resistance genes. Out of 817 specimens, 25 (3%) Enterococcus isolates, comprising 22 Enterococcus faecalis and 3 Enterococcus faecium, were Vancomycin resistant as shown by chromogenic media and Vitek 2 compact. VanB genes were confirmed by PCR with most isolates coming from urine, followed by pus then blood. Some isolates were resistant to Penicillin, Ampicillin and Clindamycin, with none being resistant to nitrofurantoin. More enterococci were isolated from urine compared to pus and blood, with most patients affected being aged between 28 and 46. More women were affected as compared to men. Brilliance chromogenic media was accurate in detection of VRE, as was PCR in confirming presence of resistance genes from the isolates. Vancomycin resistant Enterococci were isolated, with the main isolate being E. faecalis as compared to E. faecium. VanB genes were detected by PCR. The study showed presence of multidrug resistant VRE. There is need for determination of risk factors and regular surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities for VRE.

Communication tools used and their perceived effectiveness in disseminating HIV/AIDS messages for the workforce in ZAMTEL,"Nyundu, William","The report is as a result of the study on HIV/AIDS communication tools used by Zambia telecommunication company (Zamtel). Zamtel as a communication company aims at providing cost effective, comprehensive and high quality telecommunication facilities and services to its customers. The impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic has not spared Zamtel. HIV/AIDS infectious related diseases have adversely increased costs such as cost of health care, funeral costs, cost of training and recruiting workers to replace the ill and dying, medical retirement and insurance costs among others. The hindrance to the fight against HIV/AIDS is lack of effective communication tools about the disease. However, Zamtel, is responding to the HIV/AIDS challenges in different ways. Some of the approaches include work place policies and programmes, undertaking extensive prevention and education efforts within their own operations and using effective communication channels as proactive measures designed to limit the spread of HIV/AIDS and its effects among the employees. The study intended to establish the communication tools used and their perceived effectiveness in disseminating HIV/AIDS messages for the workforce in Zamtel. For that reason, the report presents communication tools used such as workshops, seminars, magazines distribution, health talks, interpersonal communication and electronic media to disseminate HIV/AIDS information to employees. The findings showed that the majority of the respondents, 69.1 percent, revealed that the HIV/AIDS communication dissemination methods used by Zamtel were effective but the degree of effectiveness varied. Ultimately, the report presents recommendations for the future basing on the analysis of the findings of the study. Among the recommendations are that, Zamtel to seriously train peer educators among employees who will confidently and effectively disseminate HIV/AIDS information, Zamtel to use employees who have opened up living with HIV/AIDS to give testimony to help in behavioural change and also Zamtel to incorporate HIV/AIDS information during departmental meetings with staff.",
The Language of initial Literacy in a Cosmopolitan Enviroment: A Case of Cinyanja in Lusaka District,"Mwanza, David Sani","The language-in-education policy in Zambia is that in grade one, the language of instruction for initial literacy is the familiar local language spoken in an area. From grade two onwards, the language of instruction is English. However, there are regions such as Lusaka which is cosmopolitan; with so many people from different ethnic backgrounds yet Cinyanja is the language of initial literacy based on the assumption that it is the language of play in the district.It was from this background that a study was conducted. The purpose of the study was to find out if Cinyanja was appropriate for use as a language of initial literacy in Lusaka considering the fact that Lusaka was a cosmopolitan environment.The research design was a case study. Both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection were used. Interview guides, lesson observation checklists and a familiar language test were administered.The target population consisted of all the government basic schools in Lusaka District, all the grade one teachers and all the grade one pupils. The sample consisted of 6 basic schools, 6 head teachers, 38 grade one teachers, 120 pupils from the 6 schools were tested and all the grade one pupils in the 6 sampled schools were part of the sample. The data was analysed qualitatively. It was grouped into identified themes according to research objectives.The findings revealed that Cinyanja was the language of play in high and medium density areas and the dominant language of play in the low density area was English. However, other languages such as Bemba, Tonga and Nsenga were also spoken by children during play.",
Economic Introspection: The cure for Africa's trade and general economic malaise: A critical analysis of the constraints in the generalised system of preferences as it relates to Africa,"Nchito, Mutembo","Third world countries have always sought to be treated exclusively in international trade, receiving concessions to prop up their economies and pressing for every exception imaginable to be forwarded to them to make their international trade prospects brighter.\r\nThe GATT as an instrument seeking to regulate international trade has been criticised by third world countries for expecting them to trade on an equal basis with developed economies. This among other things for instance led to the inclusion in the Havana charter article fifteen which provided that new preferences could be granted in the interest of development or reconstruction of one or more of the parties to the GATT. Further part four of the GATT was also included to recognise the peculiar development needs of L.D.Cs. To that end many exceptions to the egalitarian principal underlying the GATT have been formulated over the years, but still many developing countries are not happy with these concessions.This paper attempts to sample the L.D.Cs complaints vis-a-vis the operation of the generalised system of preferences with a deliberate emphasis on Africa which continent is of obvious interest to the writer.\r\nThe paper attempts to show that even though Africa may be mistreated or mocked by a system such as the G.S.P, there is a way of benefiting from it especially one of close intra African economic co-operation which would enable Africa to give a formidable front in international trade.\r\nChapter one, ""Towards the G.S.P"" is an attempt to trace the genesis of the GATT outlining its principal tenets and proceeding to epitomise the genesis of the G.S.P.Chapter two attempts to study the nature of the G.S.P and also to identify some of the weaknesses which disadvantage third world countries but seek to show that despite these the G.S.P could still be exploited to Africa's advantage.\r\nChapter three is an attempt to discuss economic co¬operation in some depth with a view to justifying the assertion that economic co-operation could solve some of Africa's mistreatment on the international market scene and proceed to identify some efforts at economic co-operation and also some defects in the same and so\r\nsuggest how we think efficacious economic co-operation could be attained.The last chapter seeks to conclude the matter by recapulating the defects pointed out in the G.S.P and seek to show how benefits could still be derived from the G.S.P. or else show that Africa is could still be economically viable with or without the G.S.P.",

"Evaluation of Vitamin B12 and Folate Levels in Megaloblastic Anaemia,Diagnosed Morphologically,at the University Teaching Hospital,lusaka,Zambia","Ndhlovu, Jacob","Master of Science degree in Pathology (Haematology)~Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is a well-known health problem.\r\nDeficiencies of folic acid and vitamin B12 are known to cause megaloblastic anaemia,\r\nwhich is characterised by presence of abnormally large erythrocyte precursor cells,\r\nmegaloblasts, in the bone marrow and macrocytic red cells in the peripheral blood. These\r\nmegaloblasts arise because of impaired deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis followed\r\nby ineffective erythropoiesis. However, vitamin B12 or folate levels have not been\r\ndescribed in Zambia, whether normal levels or in relation to anaemia.\r\nThe study aimed to determine vitamin B12 and folate levels in megaloblastic\r\nanaemia, diagnosed morphologically, in patients at the University Teaching.\r\nThis was a case control study which was undertaken at the\r\nUniversity Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, Zambia. Full blood count (FBC),\r\nPeripheral smears and ELISA were assessed on blood samples received from\r\nmegaloblastic anaemia and non-anaemic patients. The age range was between 18 – 54\r\nyears (Mean age-31 years). Among the 40 megaloblastic patients, 35% (14/40) were male\r\nand 65% (26/40) were female with a male to female ratio of 1:1.9. Full blood count and\r\nperipheral smear findings revealed that bicytopenia was present in 22.5% (9/40) and\r\npancytopenia in 72.5% (29/40) patients. Furthermore, the results showed megaloblastic\r\nanaemia participants had statistically significant lower median vitamin B12 concentration\r\n175 (150-333)pg/ml than non-anaemic control participants 299.5 (238-571)pg/ml\r\n=0.0001. Megaloblastic anaemia participants also had a statistically significant lower\r\nfolate concentration (12.32± 2.28 ng/ml) than non-anaemic control participants (19.28 ±\r\n2.84 ng/ml) =0.029. Of the megaloblastic anaemia patients, vitamin B12 deficiency was\r\nin 60% (24/40), pure folate deficiency in 30% (12/40) and combined deficiency was\r\nobserved in 15% (6/40) patients. A weak negative correlation was found between vitamin\r\nB12 and mean corpuscular volume but statistically significant (r= 0.0278, =0.001).\r\nHowever, there was no statistical significant correlation between folate and mean\r\ncorpuscular volume (r = 0.098, = 0.326).\r\nThis study shows that majority of patients with megaloblastic anaemia,\r\ndiagnosed morphologically, at the University Teaching Hospital have a deficiency of\r\nvitamin B12 deficiency.",University of Zambia
Genetic analysis of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. WALP) agronomic variables in phosphorus limiting soil.,"Chikalipa, Emmanuel","Thesis~Cowpea is an important cultivated grain legume pulse, vegetable and fodder crop of\r\nAfrican origin. However, yields have been characteristically low as a result of both \r\nabiotic and biotic stresses. Among the abiotic stresses, yield losses due to phosphorus \r\n(P) deficiency is an important factor. Identification and selection of cowpea \r\ngenotypes possessing suitable agronomic traits is key for cultivar design and \r\ndevelopment to increase production. Accordingly, genetic improvement in cowpea \r\naims to develop cultivars with improved grain yields and tolerance to abiotic and \r\nbiotic stress factors. The objectives of the study were to (i) identify high yielding \r\ncowpea genotypes when exposed to P-limiting soil, (ii) determine the cowpea \r\nheritability response of yield and its associated variables when exposed to P-limiting \r\nsoil and (iii) identify the variables with high discriminating capability among cowpea \r\ngenotypes in P-limiting soil. Twenty cowpea genotypes comprising of twelve crosses \r\nand eight progenitors were evaluated for agronomic variables performance in P limited soil at the University of Zambia Greenhouse in Lusaka. The experiment was \r\narranged as a two set experiment (i.e. applied rate of i) 0kg P2O5 /ha and ii) 60kg \r\nP2O5/ha [a control]) and laid as a completely randomized design (CRD) with 3 \r\nreplications. Comparisons using a paired t- test revealed a significant increase in \r\nperformance in a control (60kg P2O5 /ha) for all measured variables across genotypes \r\nwhen compared to a 0 Kg P2O5 / ha experimental set. In this study, genotype [LT 11-\r\n3-3-12] and a cross [LT 3-8-4-1 X LT 11-5-1-1] were identified as the highest \r\nperformers exhibiting a mean yield of 1994.90 kg/ha and 1984 kg/ha respectively in \r\na P-limiting soil. The narrow sense heritability for measured variables ranged from\r\n11- 35 % and 12 -72% for 0 Kg P2O5 and 60 Kg P2O5 experimental set respectively. \r\nThe highest narrow sense heritability scores in a limiting P experimental set were for \r\npod length (h2= 0.35) and root biomass (h2= 0.28) while in the control set the \r\nvariable yield (h2= 0.72) had the highest score. Variables plant biomass, root \r\nbiomass, number of pods and pod length were identified as ideal at discriminating \r\ngenotypic performance responses in P- limiting soil. These findings imply that high yielding cowpea genotypes with acceptable P deficiency can be developed.\r\nKeywords: Cowpea, yield, phosphorus, discriminating, principal component analysis, \r\nHeritability",The University of Zambia
Prevalence and incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus in HIV infected persons on HAART in Chongwe district in Lusaka province.,"Hamoonga, Bona Mwiinga","Thesis~The Zambia National strategic plan (ZNHSP)-2011-2017 highlights the need for risk factor \r\nstratification at the community level to form the basis of incidence and prevalence data, which \r\nare currently inadequate. This research aims to determine the prevalence and incidence of \r\nhypertension and diabetes among HIV infected patients on Highly Active Anti-Retroviral \r\nTherapy (HAART) and its association with ARVs use. A retrospective cohort study was used \r\nusing the SMART CARE electronic database in Chongwe district to assess 2,070 HIV infected \r\npersons on HAART. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20, and analyzed using Chi-square \r\nKruskal-Wallis for analysis of variance, and logistic regression was used to establish the \r\ndeterminants of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus among HIV infected persons on \r\nHAART. 33.8% HIV positive clients on HAART had hypertension, and an incident case fatality \r\nrate of 85.7 cases per 1000 PYFU of hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension was \r\nsignificantly higher (?2=49.238, df=1; p<0.001) among men (64%) than among women (49%).\r\nThe prevalence of hypertension also differed significantly (?2=11.194, df=2; p=0.004) among \r\ndifferent age categories and was highest (57.2%) among the 18-45 years age bracket. This study \r\nalso found a significant correlation between hypertension and age of client in years (p=0.009). \r\nThe study also found an incident rate of 37.4 cases per 1000 PYFU of T2DM. This study also \r\nestablished no significant differences in the prevalence of type II diabetes mellitus between \r\nwomen (26%) and men (23%). However, the prevalence of diabetes differed significantly \r\n((?2=10.043, df=2; p=0.007) among different age categories and was highest (27.5%) among the \r\n56 years and older age bracket. Results of logistical regression analysis for the determinants \r\nT2DM and hypertension show that ART combination (p=0.001), age category (p=0.011) and \r\ncigarette smoking (p=0.0460) significantly added to the prediction model for T2DM outcome; \r\nand that ART combination (p=0.004), sex (p=0.001), family history of hypertension (p=0.007) \r\nand cigarette smoking (p=0.001) had significant associations with and significantly added to the \r\nprediction model for hypertension outcome. HIV positive clients on HAART had high \r\nprevalence and incidence of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. HAART combination \r\nregimen of two NRTI classes plus either a PI or INSTI were associated with higher incidence of \r\nhypertension whilst combination regimens of two NRTIs plus an NNRTI or INSTI and \r\ncombination therapy of NRTI+NNRTI+INSTI were associated with higher incidence of type II \r\ndiabetes mellitus in HAART treated clients.",The University of Zambia
The effect of night time diuretic chronotherapy on quality and duration of sleep among Zambian hypertensive patients,"Banda, David","Masters in Clinical Pharmacy~Poor sleep plays an important role in the prevalence of hypertension. It increases the\r\nprevalence rate to 60%. It is thought that sleep regulates stress hormones and helps\r\nnervous system. Overtime, lack of sleep hurt the body ability to regulate stress\r\nhormones, leading to high blood pressure. The night time dosing of blood pressure\r\nlowering drugs have yielded positive results. Scholars have rarely investigated the\r\nrelationship between night time dosing of diuretics and the quality of sleep. The\r\nstudy aimed at evaluating quality and duration of sleep while on night time dosing of\r\ndiuretics and determine the commonly used blood pressure lowering medication at\r\nUniversity Teaching Hospital.\r\nMethods: The sample consisted of 43 patients with hypertension and on diuretic, 25\r\nof whom were taking their medication in the evening at 10 PM and 18 were in the 10\r\nAM dosing schedule. The BP was measured with cuff sphygmomanometer at\r\nenrolment and follow-ups. The quality of sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh\r\nSleep Quality Index (PSQI) score while the duration of sleep was measured with\r\nEpworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score at enrolment and follow-ups. A PSQI score of\r\nless than 5 indicated good sleeps while an ESS score of 1-6 as a good duration of\r\nsleep.\r\nResults: Overall, 43 were included in the analysis. The 10AM group had 18 (41.8%),\r\nwhile the 10PM group had 25 (58.2%) at enrolment. The study recruited more\r\nwomen (72.0%) and the majority were on hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride\r\ncombination (72.0%). The 10PM dosing showed significant differences in quality of\r\nsleep with p-value of 0.010 at 12 weeks follow-up. The duration of sleep did not\r\nshow significant differences between the groups with p-value of 0.215. The blood\r\npressure lowering was significant in the 10PM group with p-value of 0.020 at 12\r\nweeks follow-up. Conclusions: The study suggested that the 10PM dosing of\r\ndiuretics in hypertensive patients and the diuretic effect does not affect the quality\r\nand duration of sleep. Further, 10PM dosing lowers the blood pressure significantly\r\ncompared with 10AM.",University of Zambia
Knowledge Among Parents/Guardians On The Presentation Of Paediatric HIV/AIDS And Related Factors,"Chintu, Namwinga","Zambia similar to other sub Saharan countries has high sero prevalence rates of HIV. In spite of several campaigns and strategies to improve HIV/AIDS awareness, paediatric HIV/AIDS cases in Zambia continue to rise. Despite the now available ARV's, few children are brought forward to access care. Possible reasons for this continued rise were explored in this study.\r\n\r\nThis quantitative descriptive study aimed to document awareness of parents/guardians of symptomatic paediatric AIDS among children under five years in a primary and tertiary health institution. Knowledge on mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and symptomatology of HIV among 331 parents/guardians attending Kabwata Health Center and University Teaching Hospital was assessed using a structured questionnaire.\r\n\r\nParents/ guardians are aware of mother to child transmission of HIV (MTCT) during pregnancy (36 %), labour and delivery (16%), and through breastfeeding (26%). Of note was that parents thought that HIV can be hospital acquired through use of unsterilised needles and syringes.\r\nJust over 50% of respondents thought that an apparently healthy child was a guarantee that the child's parents were free from HIV infection and this may be a contributing factor to the low utilisation of voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services.\r\nSigns and symptoms of HIV infection volunteered by parents were non-specific. Specific signs and symptoms only accounted for 16% of the total responses. Half of the respondents were aware of the availability of anti-retroviral drugs for the management of HIV infection as well as for PMTCT. More than 80% of respondents were willing to under go VCT if they suspected their child of having HIV infection.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInsufficient and inaccurate knowledge among parents and care givers about paediatric HIV/AIDS is one of the important reasons for low VCT uptake and may be indirectly responsible for the increase in infant morbidity and mortality in Zambia. The study has shown the need for sustained aggressive community sensitization on the presentation and management of paediatric HIV/AIDS",
Transaction costs and smallholder household access to maize markets in Zambia,"Bwalya, Richard~Mugisha, Johnny~Hyuha, Theodora","This is a full length Research Paper a part of a masters thesis.~After liberalization of the Zambian economy, farmers were faced with the responsibility of finding the right buyers, negotiating prices and delivering produce leading to them incurring transaction costs. This study aimed at identifying and quantifying transaction costs factors and their impact on maize market participation for small holder farmers in Zambia. The study used primary data collected from a sample of 240 randomly selected households from Zambia’s central Province. The Heckman’s procedure was used to analyze factors affecting the likelihood and extent of participation in maize markets. The logit results (from the Heckman’s two-stage process) show that ownership of assets such as radios and having access to alternative marketing channels increased the likelihood of market participation while the heckit results (OLS corrected for selectivity bias) shows that ownership of oxcarts, increased family size and experience in maize marketing were the factors that increased quantities of maize marketed. The study recommends provision of market information, improving accessibility to markets as well as increasing access to productive assets as means of alleviating impact of transaction costs.~Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)\r\nGerman Academic Exchange Service",Journal of Development and Agricultural Economics
Consumer perceptions and determinants of demand for Cassava products in Lusaka District,"Mboma, Grace","Cassava is an important crop in many parts of the country, with an area under cultivation estimated to be 47 per cent of that under maize. Upon introduction of various crop diversification projects, its production has been on the rise. Currently, most cassava grown in Zambia is used for household food security, although there are still opportunities for increased sales to consumers, particularly in urban areas.\r\n\r\nWith much of the focus being on increasing supply, a persistent challenge to the cassava industry has been little availability of knowledge on demand for the crop and its products. A study was carried out in Lusaka District, aimed at determining the factors affecting demand for cassava products and the role of consumer perceptions on demand.\r\n\r\nThe general objective of this study was to find out the perceptions of consumers towards cassava and the factors that affect their demand. The specific objectives were to identify the factors affecting quantity of cassava demanded by households, to describe the socio economic characteristics of cassava consumers and to assess the role of consumer perception on quantity of cassava demanded.\r\n\r\nA structured questionnaire was the primary instrument used for data collection. SPSS was used to generate descriptives while a regression model was run in STATA to determine which factors were significant. The value of cassava expenditure per household was used as a proxy for quantity of cassava demanded. Based on the results of the regression, price of maize meal, consumer preference and price of cassava meal were found to be significant, with p values of 0.002, 0.037 and 0.002, respectively.\r\n\r\nRecommendations that came out as a result of this research were that the government should embark on a series of promotion programs in order to raise awareness of cassava benefits. This can be done at household level, in schools and also hospitals. Markets for cassava could also be improved by minimising the transportation costs that exist between the production and consumption points. To make cassava attractive to more farmers, a similar program to that of the Farmer Input Support Program (FISP) can be introduced. Lastly, price policies can be put in place to avoid adverse fluctuations, especially if cassava is to serve as a food security crop.",The University of Zambia

Factors affecting coffee exports in Zambia,"Chileshe, Moses","This study investigates the factors that affect coffee exports in Zambia. A regression model is postulated based on international trade theory and estimated using SPSS. Given that there was no serious deviation from the Classical Linear Regression Model (CLRM), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) was used to estimate the model. Data for the model was obtained from Zambia Coffee Growers Association (ZCGA), Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives (MACO), Coffee Board of Zambia (CBZ), FAO's World Agriculture Information Centre (WAICENT) website on Internet, Bank of Zambia (BOZ), Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) and Central Statistics Office (CSO).The results suggested that the cost of inputs, lagged price of coffee, real exchange rate, lagged price of cotton have a significant effect on net quantity of coffee exported per capita. Except for the lagged price of coffee, the quantity of coffee exported is highly responsive to slight changes in the variables. In other words a positive increase in the lagged price of coffee will cause a small increase in the quantity of coffee exported. While for a decrease in the cost of inputs and price of cotton, there will be a greater proportionate increase in the quantity of coffee exported and the converse is also true. In the case of the exchange rate depreciation of the currency, will increase the competitiveness of the country and consequently increase the net amount of coffee exported per capita and the converse is true. The other variation not explained by the model might be due to other factors, which cannot be easily quantified such as technology, transportation, extension services, reliability of the marketing net works and organizations.Based on these findings, it is recommended that Government intervention through provision of inputs subsidies, ensuring competitive prices for coffee and reduction on the overvaluation of the kwacha will support the coffee sector and consequently increase the net quantity of coffee exported per capita. Further more government intervention through the provision of addition skills on the part of the producer, provision of suitable markets, technology and information environment will help support the coffee sector. Finally there is need for a comprehensive study to analyze the main factors affecting foreign countries imports of coffee, and to interpret the implications for Zambian coffee policy.",
"The role of student representatives on education boards : the case of Zambia Institute of special education, Copperbelt College of Education and Kitwe College of Education","Bowasi, Daniel S.","This study investigated the role of student representatives on Education Boards in three colleges, namely, the Zambia Institute of Special Education, the Copperbelt College of Education, and the Kitwe College of Education. The thesis investigated the effectiveness of the students'representatives on College Boards. Although Kitwe College of Education\r\nwas not originally part of the research, it was felt that there was need to\r\ninclude a Basic School Teachers' College whose student population consisted mostly of pupils who had just completed school and was entering college life for the very first time. A sample total of 200\r\nRespondents was selected from these three colleges out of whom 153 respondents answered the questionnaire.\r\nData were collected using questionnaires, semi structured interviews and\r\nfocus group discussions. The data from questionnaires were computer analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). On the other hand the data from interviews and focus group discussions were\r\nanalysed qualitatively by coding and grouping similar themes together\r\nusing constant comparative techniques. Tables, charts and graphs were used in the examinations and presentation of data after analysis. These were also used to examine the following major issues:\r\ni) Student participation in board meetings.\r\nii) Student participation in the financial committee.\r\niii) Student participation in the decision making process involving:\r\na) enrolment of students in the college\r\nb) disciplinary committee meetings involving both lecturers and students.\r\niv) Student participation in the policy formulation process of the\r\ncollege.\r\nVlll\r\nThe findings of the study revealed that there were varying degrees of\r\nstudent participation in the various colleges and also that the role of\r\nstudent representatives on the education boards differed from one college\r\nto the other.

Some information such as financial and audit reports was not readily available to student board members for them to make informed decisions on matters affecting their fellow students.",
Evaluation of library and information science students’ attachment programme: a case study of the University of Zambia,"Maseka, Anita","Thesis~This study was aimed evaluating the Library and Information Science students’ attachment programme-a case study of the University of Zambia. The study used a case study design to evaluate the contemporary phenomena within its real life context. The mixed methodapproach was used to evaluate the significance of Library and Information Science (LIS) student attachment programme at the University of Zambia (UNZA). A purposive sample of 70students, three (3) lecturers and three (3) supervisors was used. A descriptive design was employed under a mixed method approach that placed greater focus on the qualitative strand. Data collected from questionnaires and interview guides. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data. The study found that students received industry training, were open to new experiences, developed sense of satisfaction, developed specialised technical skills, recognised personal strengths, acquired knowledge from job duties, had the ability to work and learn independently, developed realistic ideas about real working world, had the ability to persevere and these results tallied perfectly well with the responses from their different supervisors. Further despite attachments bridging the gap between theory and practice other concerns were raised which ranged from too much workload from supervisors, not enough technological equipment in University and industry, lack of transport, lunch, accommodation costs and not enough resources to facilitate training before attachments. The study recommended that the Ministry of Higher Education to continue revising conditions during attachments, train, provide and improve human resource, coordinate various institutions to improve service delivery and lastly provide capacity building and increase other support across all sectors that host students or trainees during attachments.\r\nKeywords: Industrial attachments, internship, practical experience and experiential learning.",The University of Zambia
